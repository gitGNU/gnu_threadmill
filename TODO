== TODOs ==

# means deciding
* Merge Kit and Lib and add configure to decide to build both or not.

=== TMKit ===
* Content view scaler
* Working area implementation.
	* The working area should be scaled automatically based on node's layout.
	* A navigation system, a small map that you can drag around the view to perform the navigation.
	  You don't drag this map's contents but the map itself to navigate. eg. putting the
	  map on the top left of the main screen view would show the top left area of the working area.
	* kinetic dragging.
* Group / Ungroup support : this will be implemented using the TMView as
  a node's content view.
* Change BORDER_SIZE to 2 NSRects to allow freely extending edges for port expandable, pie menus and etc.
* Display optimizations.
* Drag content switcher to show a pie menu of alternate operations.
	* Compact : smallest display possible that still support connection
	  changing, dragging something near should show name.
	* Lock : smallest display, port only show name over wires on mouse
	  over node.
	* Delete : remove node permanently.
	* Hide : draw wire dash indicating hidden nodes.
	* Connected : only show connected ports.
	* Pin : prevent Graphviz auto adjust.
	* Proxy : just forward all ports with same names.
	* Suspend : freeze itself.
	* Wire : some nodes can just be on-the-wire without having a static
	  location and represented by a circle. The location of nodes will
	  be calculated with mesh smoothing algorithm. To make this nice,
	  the wire-wire connection should define a tangent for stroking a
	  straight line.
* Graphviz support.
* Round top corners to support the pie menu.
* Replace current drop down with a pie menu for expanding connection slot 
* When expanding connection slot, should glow light when mouse is over port
  and set up and alarmer so the expansion don't collapse as soon as mouse left
  tracking area.
* Adjust and average the initial and final wire stroke's length based on pair's distance.
  eg., the initial and final straights should be 0.1 of the total distance.
* Drag port handle left-right will change direction.
* When pressing on port cell, the connected wires could also be lighten up.
* Popup on wire for refining connection type or delete.
# Make port cell to allow content view mapping from the pair so you can edit the pair directly
  within the current port display.
* Trace intersecting node frame to draw nice drop shadow by sortng all rects'
  edges as NSPoint->NSPoint vectors, trace the edge by following intersected
  vectors' origins, fill an image then blur the pixel.
* Allow runtime choice superfluous, may be useful when drawing in zooming mode.
* Allow sorting ports above content view 

=== TMLib ===
* TMNode should not be retained by a TMNodeView but by a non-GUI manager
  retained by TMView so the mill can works in non-GUI mode.
* Method to match default connection policy, based on quality and speed.
