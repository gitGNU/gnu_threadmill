== TODOs ==

=== Looks & Feels ===
* Content scaler
* Group / Ungroup support : this will be implemented using the TMView as
  a node's content view 
* Drag content switcher to show a pie menu of alternate operations.
	# Compact : smallest display possible that still support connection
          changing, dragging something near should show name.
	# Lock : smallest display, port only show name over wires on mouse
          over node.
	# Delete : remove node permanently.
	# Hide : draw wire dash indicating hidden nodes.
	# Pin : prevent Graphviz auto adjust.
* Graphviz support.
* When expanding connection slot, should glow light when mouse is over port
  and set up and alarmer so the expansion don't collapse as soon as mouse left
  tracking area.
* Adjust the initial and final stroke's length based on pair's distance
* Drag port handle left-right will change direction.
* When pressing on port cell, the connected cables could also be lighten up.
* Trace intersecting node frame to draw nice drop shadow by sortng all rects'
  edges as NSPoint->NSPoint vectors, trace the edge by following intersected
  vectors' origins.
* Allow runtime choice superfluous, may be useful when drawing in zooming mode.

=== Object Model ===
* TMNode should not be retained by a TMNodeView but by a non-GUI manager
  retained by TMView so the mill can works in non-GUI mode.
