# means deciding

=== Looks & Feels ===
* Content view scaler
* Group / Ungroup support : this will be implemented using the TMView as
  a node's content view.
* Change BORDER_SIZE to 2 NSRects to allow freely extending edges for port expandable, pie menus and etc.
* Display optimizations.
* Drag content switcher to show a pie menu of alternate operations.
	* Compact : smallest display possible that still support connection
          changing, dragging something near should show name.
	* Lock : smallest display, port only show name over wires on mouse
          over node.
	* Delete : remove node permanently.
	* Hide : draw wire dash indicating hidden nodes.
	* Pin : prevent Graphviz auto adjust.
	* Proxy : just forward all ports with same names.
	* Suspend : freeze itself.
	* Wire : some nodes can just be on-the-wire without having a static
          location and represented by a circle. The location of nodes will
          be calculated with mesh smoothing algorithm. To make this nice,
          the wire-wire connection should define a tangent for stroking a
          straight line.
* Graphviz support.
* Round top corners to support the pie menu.
* Replace current drop down with a pie menu for expanding connection slot 
* When expanding connection slot, should glow light when mouse is over port
  and set up and alarmer so the expansion don't collapse as soon as mouse left
  tracking area.
* Adjust and average the initial and final wire stroke's length based on pair's distance.
  eg., the initial and final straights should be 0.1 of the total distance.
* Drag port handle left-right will change direction.
* When pressing on port cell, the connected wires could also be lighten up.
# Make port cell to allow content view mapping from the pair so you can edit the pair directly
  within the current port display.
* Trace intersecting node frame to draw nice drop shadow by sortng all rects'
  edges as NSPoint->NSPoint vectors, trace the edge by following intersected
  vectors' origins, fill an image then blur the pixel.
* Allow runtime choice superfluous, may be useful when drawing in zooming mode.

=== Object Model ===
* TMNode should not be retained by a TMNodeView but by a non-GUI manager
  retained by TMView so the mill can works in non-GUI mode.
