 ______________________/ ABOUT \_______________________________________________

  Threadmill aims to build a high level GUI system to manage graph nodes with
  customizable front ends that allow wrapping any kind of node from real time
  generated unix cmdline output to Objective-C method calls. 
                                          _________
 ________________________________________/ DESIGNS \___________________________

  Threadmill is designed to run with or without GUI and can be categorized
  in 3 modules, the library, the palettes and the applications. The library
  also separated into GUI and non-GUI layers.  The non-GUI only expose nodes
  and port names to the GUI layer. The only way to access the ports is to
  refer to them by names and only nodes will post notifications when certain
  events occured such as data available or new connection is estrablished so
  the GUI layer can update.

  All the design decisions will be made with concerns of the original purpose
  of using Threadmill to support part of 3Σ's operation dependency system.

  (3Σ is a 3D mesh and object relationship modeling software based on the
  being developed AP3 framework.)
